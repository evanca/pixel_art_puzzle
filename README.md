# Pixel Art Puzzle

This app is my submission for a Flutter Puzzle Hack Challenge.

The app idea was inspired by pixel art and the goal of the app is to take any picture and turn it into a retro-looking pixel art image. There is an option to use a random image or to upload your own.

## About the project

### Features
- Turning a picture into pixel art to play with
- 4 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard and Insane
- Fetching random images from Pixabay API
- Uploading and pixelating custom image
- Colorful confetti animation on puzzle complete

### Offline support
- When image API is not responding, user can still use custom image upload and proceed to play
